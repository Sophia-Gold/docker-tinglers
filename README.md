# Docker Tinglers

Fork of [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker.git) with names generated in the style of best-selling author [Dr. Chuck Tingle](http://www.chucktingle.com/).

[This tutorial](http://oyvindsk.com/writing/docker-build-from-source) on building Docker from source may be helpful.

Please note it is likely a very bad idea to use this in a workplace environment.
